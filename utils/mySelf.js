        `Hello! I'm Mohammed Jaasir, an enthusiastic individual with a deep interest in programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Autonomous Systems. 
        Since childhood, I’ve enjoyed exploring code, creating loops, and experimenting with inspect element.
        At 16, I decided to turn my passion for technology into a career.

        I’ve worked on exciting projects, like AI-based pedestrian safety solutions, autonomous vehicle systems using deep learning, and a GPS hardware product for fishermen in remote areas.

        My team was also shortlisted in the Data Sprint 2.0 hackathon.





        With a strong foundation in programming and hardware, I'm passionate about solving real-world challenges, especially in automotive and smart mobility sectors.
